# Happy New Year - React

This is a small Vite + React port of the original static page.

Quick start:

1. Open a terminal in `react-app`.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app keeps the same styles and animations as the original. If you'd like, I can further tweak the component structure or add types.
